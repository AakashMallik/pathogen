The app provides substitutes to the medicines, while showing the availability of these medicines in the nearby chemists.
It can really help us find cheap drug alternatives  while saving our time for checking too many chemists in case.

#### Features of our project:
* Search medicines by either their name or substitute(generic).
* Medicine names can be selected from dropdown autocomplete lists.
* Alternatives can be seen for a particular medicines from different manufacturers which have the same composition with their market price.
* The location of availability of each medicine can be found out within a user's viscinity determined by their GPS coordinates(manual location selection also available for non GPS devices).

#### We have two branches for our project:
>1. **master**:  _for frontend contents_
2. **backend**:  _for backend API's_
